might try typing `S' now just to see what is salvageable.

I can't figure out why you would want to use a tab mark
here. If you just want an ampersand, the remedy is
simple: Just type `I\&' now. But if some right brace

you're probably due for more error messages, and you

./VL_8.tex:20: LaTeX Error: \begin{document} ended by \end{align*}.

See the LaTeX manual or LaTeX Companion for explanation.
Type  H <return>  for immediate help.

Your command was ignored.
Type  I <command> <return>  to replace it with another command,
or  <return>  to continue without it.

./VL_8.tex:20: Missing $ inserted.
<inserted text> 
                $
l.20 \end{align*}
                 
I've inserted something that you may have forgotten.
(See the <inserted text> above.)
With luck, this will get me unwedged. But if you
really didn't forget anything, try typing `2' now; then
my insertion and my current dilemma will both disappear.
